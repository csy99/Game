# LightsOut

# Rules and Explanation:

The game initially consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible.

# Possible Improvements:

Find solutions for each lights pattern and compute the minimum move required. Offer hints when user get stuck.
